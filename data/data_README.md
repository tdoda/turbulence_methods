# Data storage

## VMP data

The turbulence data is too large to be stored on Github: all .p, .mat and .png files are ignored by git (see `.gitignore` file).

You can find all the data files [here](https://unils-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/tomy_doda_unil_ch/IgC7Ht70M-skS4hcPThIAfLIAWhHfxWdKAnN60TNISHNqUQ?e=n3ZkgD) and copy them to your local repository.
